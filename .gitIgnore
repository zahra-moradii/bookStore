To run a Fastify project on a laptop with no dependencies installed, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   - Download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/)
   - npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js, so you don't need a separate installation.

2. **Clone the Project:**
   - Clone or download the Fastify project from your version control system (e.g., Git).

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Fastify project is located.

4. **Install Project Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies specified in the `package.json` file:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

5. **Run the Project:**
   - After the dependencies are installed, you can start the Fastify server. Use one of the defined npm scripts, for example:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     This command typically starts the development server with features like auto-reloading.

6. **Access the Fastify Server:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the Fastify server is running. By default, Fastify may run on `http://localhost:3003` during development.

7. **Optional: Install Global Dependencies:**
   - Some projects may have global dependencies. Check the project's documentation for any additional requirements.
   - For global dependencies, you might need administrator (root) access.

Note: Ensure that your laptop has internet access during the installation process to download npm packages.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run the Fastify project on your laptop with Node.js and npm installed.
